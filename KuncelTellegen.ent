macro:->This
is
a
very
interesting
finding,
and
one
that
has
been
replicated
several
times,
but
the
focus
of
this
exploration
is
fully
\emph
{procedural},
and
pointed
directly
at
the
\emph
{method}
used
to
collect
item
social
desirability
ratings
rather
than
the
larger
implications
of
attraction
toward
the
socially
desirable.

regressions
were
also
conducted

in
this

these

macro:->Note
that
two
of
these
analyses
share
some
inellegance
due
to
a
categorization
of
Edwards'
values
(e.g.,
there
are
ranges
of
values
within
each
of
these
5
categories;
see,
for
example,
Cohen,
1983)
-
we
chose
to
categorize
within
crude
strata
because
such
oversimplification
\emph
{does}
quite
dramatically
facilitate
the
communication
of
these
results.
