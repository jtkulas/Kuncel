To do for Kuncel & Tellegen:

1) put mono & linear rating forms on repository (KULAS)
2) fill in European authors who have been doing direct SD item ratings [line 80] (take from student paper) (KULAS)
3) find recent rebuttal of Ones Red Herring paper - possibly also faking (KULAS)
4) explain Figure 2 - currently explained twice but neither explanation makes sense (KULAS)

Results should be: 

1) similarity/uniqueness of information
2) inter-rater consistency (of judge ratings)
3) cognitive difficulty of rating process
