	title = {A Meta-Analytic Investigation of Job Applicant Faking on Personality Measures},
	abstract = {This study investigates the extent to which job applicants fake their responses on personality tests. Thirty-three studies that compared job applicant and non-applicant personality scale scores were meta-analyzed. Across all job types, applicants scored significantly higher than non-applicants on extraversion (d5.11), emotional stability (d5.44), conscientiousness (d5.45), and openness (d5.13). For certain jobs (e.g., sales), however, the rank ordering of mean differences changed substantially suggesting that job applicants distort responses on personality dimensions that are viewed as particularly job relevant. Smaller mean differences were found in this study than those reported by Viswesvaran and Ones (Educational and Psychological Measurement, 59(2), 197–210), who compared scores for induced ‘‘fake-good’ ’ vs. honest response conditions. Also, direct Big Five measures produced substantially larger differences than did indirect Big Five measures. T here has been a resurgence of interest in the use ofpersonality variables in industrial/organizational psy-chology since the early 1990s. This resurgence is due in part to the emergence of the five-factor (Big Five) model of personality (Digman, 1990) and meta-analytic evidence that supports the usefulness of personality measures for the prediction of performance across a wide variety of jobs},
